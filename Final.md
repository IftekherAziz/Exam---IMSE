### **Slide: The Vision: Utility Computing**

**Summary**:
- **Background**: The idea of computing as a utility has roots in science fiction, particularly in Isaac Asimov's 1956 short story *"The Last Question."*
- **Themes in the Story**: 
  - Explores deep questions of entropy, knowledge, and the universe's fate.
  - Describes advanced futuristic computers (Multivac, Microvac, Galactic AC, Cosmic AC) tasked with solving how to reverse entropy and prevent the universe's end.
  - The ultimate solution results in creating a new universe after the old one collapses.
- **Quote Highlight**: “He stared somberly at his small AC-contact. It was only two inches cubed... connected through hyperspace with the great Galactic AC that served all mankind.”
