### **Summary of Slide: OS-level Virtualization**

#### **Key Concepts**
- **OS-level Virtualization**:
  - Host OS kernel allows the creation of multiple **isolated user-space instances**.

- **Container**:
  - A runtime instance that packages everything needed to run an application:
    - Code, runtime libraries, environment variables, and configuration files.
  - Lightweight compared to full virtual machines.
  - Example: **Docker**.

- **Comparison**:
