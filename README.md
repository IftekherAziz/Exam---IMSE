**Examples**:
- **Valid Elements**:
  - `<_card>`
  - `<Card.Info>`
  - `<Card-Info_box>`
- **Invalid Elements**:
  - `<xML_book>` (invalid case for naming conventions).
  - `<.tag>` (cannot start with a special character).
  - `<Card Header>` (spaces are not allowed in names).
  - `<1Header>` (cannot start with a number).
  - `<Address:Street>` (colon in this position is not valid).

**Explanation**:  
XML elements must follow specific naming conventions and syntactical rules to be considered well-formed, ensuring parsability and adherence to XML standards.

### **Page 39: XML Syntax**
**Summary**:
- Must be **well-formed**: Proper nesting and closing of tags.
- Tags are case-sensitive.
- Attributes must be quoted.
- A single root element encapsulates all content.

**Explanation**: Adhering to XML syntax ensures documents are parsable and interpretable.
